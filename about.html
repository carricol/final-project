            <h1> Hello there! </h1>
            <h3> Welcome to my portfolio :)</h3>
            <p>First, an introduction: My name is Lauren Carrico and I am soon-to-be graduate from Michigan State University with a degree in Information Science and a minor in Spanish. However, my true passion is for creating. From a young age, I found a calling to videography and video editing, which has now developed in a career in digital media and creative services. As I look to enter the workforce, I want to pair this lifelong passion that I have spent years cultivating with a professional career where my work can reach wider audiences and have impacts on culture and entertainment. The work displayed in this portfolio are projects I am incredibly proud of, and only the tip of the iceberg in what I still have to learn and hone my craft in. So, take a look around, read over my resume, and if I'm the person you're looking for, shoot me a message!</p>
